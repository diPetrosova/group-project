          ABC is a pioneering global travel brand that’s provided trusted travel
          advice since 1992, when founder Uncle Sam established the ABC Travel
          Guide to several countries such as China, France, Spain, Japan,
          Thailand and Turkey. Combining a journalistic approach with an
          understanding of what travellers really need to know, the website's
          instant success quickly covered half a dozen of destinations,
          attracting a loyal readership hungry for ABC Travel Guides’ trademark
          “tell-it-like-it-is” ethos.
