                If you decide to travel, review the travel health notice for COVID-19 and International Travel.<br>
                You should complete a COVID-19 vaccine series, along with any additional recommended doses in 
                Canada at least 14 days before travelling.<br>
                <br>
                Anyone who has not completed a COVID-19 vaccine series should continue to avoid non-essential travel 
                to all destinations. If you must travel, consider delaying your plans until you’re fully vaccinated.

    <h2 class="header3">Travel Advice and Advisories</h2>
    <p class="p2">
        The Travel Advice and Advisories are the Government of Canada’s official source of destination-specific travel information.
        They give you important advice to help you to make informed decisions and to travel safely while you are abroad.<br>
        <br>
        No matter where you plan to travel, make sure you check the Travel Advice and Advisories page for your destination twice: 
        once when you are planning your trip, and again shortly before you leave. Safety and security conditions may change between 
        the date you book your travel and your departure date.<br>
