            This is a traditional French soup made of onions and beef stock,
            usually served with croutons and melted cheese on top. Dating back
            to Roman times, this was traditionally a peasant dish although the
            current version dates from the 18th century. The soup’s unique
            flavor comes from the caramelization of the onions, which often have
            brandy or sherry added during the slow-cooking process. If you’re in
            a soup mood, why not try Marseille’s traditional soupe de poisson à
            la rouille. Once a fisherman’s favorite, this soup is characterized
            by a dollop of garlic and saffron mayonnaise placed on top.

            This quintessential French food was popularized by Julia Child,
            becoming one of her signature dishes. The dish sees chicken braised
            with wine, mushrooms, salty pork or bacon (lardons), mushrooms,
            onions, garlic and sometimes even a drop of brandy. Although the
            name translates as ‘rooster in wine’ – the braising is ideal for
            tougher birds – the recipe usually uses chicken or capon. The wine
            is typically Burgundy, although regional variations of the dish
            exist across France that use local wines. These include coq au vin
            jaune (Jura), coq au Riesling (Alsace), and coq au pourpre
            (Beaujolais nouveau). Believe it or not, there’s even a coq au
            Champagne (Champagne).

          <p>
            Cassoulet is a comfort dish of white beans stewed slowly with meat.
            The dish typically uses pork or duck but can include sausages,
            goose, mutton or whatever else the chef has lying around. This
            peasant dish originates from southern France and is popular in
            Toulouse, Carcassonne, and Castelnaudary. The name of the dish comes
            from the pot (cassole) that it’s traditionally baked in. This pot is
            a staple in many French homes, highlighting the popularity of this
            rich, hearty meal that’s perfect for those colder months.

            Dishes don’t get much more typically French than bœuf bourguignon.
            The dish hails from the same region as coq au vin – that’s Burgundy
            in eastern France – and there are similarities between the two
            dishes. Bœuf bourguignon is essentially a stew made from beef
            braised in red wine, beef broth, and seasoned vegetables including
            pearl onions and mushrooms. Originally a peasant dish, this recipe
            is now a staple in French restaurants around the world.
            Traditionally, the cheap cuts of meat would be tenderized in wine
            for two days to intensify the flavors, although some shortcuts can
            be taken. Every August in Burgundy, the Fête du Charolais celebrates
            the dish, along with plenty of music and wine.

          <p>
            The word soufflé comes from the French verb ‘to blow’ and, as the
            name suggests, this is a light, airy dessert. The dish dates back to
            the early 18th century and nowadays is a staple on dessert menus
            around the world. The crispy chocolatey crust is perfect for letting
            the creamy chocolate ooze out for a rich surprise. However, it
            doesn’t have to be sweet. In fact, cheese soufflés are just as
            delicious if you’re looking for something a little saltier.

          <p>
            Flamiche means ‘cake’ in Dutch and this dish originates from
            northern France, near the border with Belgium. It has a puff-pastry
            crust filled with cheese and vegetables and resembles a quiche. The
            traditional filling is leeks and cream, although various variations
            exist. There’s also a pizza-like version of flamiche, which comes
            without the top crust of the pie. For a southern French twist, try
            the thin crusty pissaladière, which has anchovies, onions, and
            olives.
