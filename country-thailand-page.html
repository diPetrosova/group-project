<h2 class="header1">Thailand</h2>
        <p class="p1"><span>
            <strong>Thailand</strong>, country located in the centre of mainland Southeast Asia. Located wholly within 
            the tropics, Thailand encompasses diverse ecosystems, including the hilly forested areas of the northern
            frontier, the fertile rice fields of the central plains, the broad plateau of the northeast, and the rugged
            coasts along the narrow southern peninsula. Until the second half of the 20th century, Thailand was primarily 
            an agricultural country, but since the 1960s increasing numbers of people have moved to Bangkok, the capital, 
            and to other cities. Although the greater Bangkok metropolitan area remains the preeminent urban centre in 
            the country, there are other sizable cities, such as Chiang Mai in the north, Nakhon Ratchasima (Khorat), 
            Khon Kaen, and Udon Thani in the northeast, Pattaya in the southeast, and Hat Yai in the far south. Siam, 
            as Thailand was officially called until 1939, was never brought under European colonial domination. 
            Independent Siam was ruled by an absolute monarchy until a revolution there in 1932.

    <p class="p3"><span>Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy, and all subsequent constitutions have provided 
        for an elected parliament. Political authority, however, has often been held by the military, which has taken 
        power through coups. During the last two decades of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st, 
        parliamentary democracy steadily gained wider popular support. Although a crisis emerged in 2006, when the 
        military, aligned with the monarchy, overthrew an elected government, new parliamentary elections were held—as 
        promised by the interim government—in 2007. Thailand, which has about the same land area as Spain or France, 
        consists of two broad geographic areas: a larger main section in the north and a smaller peninsular extension 
        in the south. The main body of the country is surrounded by Myanmar (Burma) to the west, Laos to the north and 
        east, Cambodia to the southeast, and the Gulf of Thailand to the south. Peninsular Thailand stretches southward
        from the southwestern corner of the country along the eastern edge of the Malay Peninsula.

        Thailand’s landscapes vary from low mountains to fertile alluvial plains dotted with rice paddies to sandy 
        beaches set amid the equatorial latitudes of the Asian monsoons. 
        <br><br>
        The country is divided into five distinct physiographic regions: the folded mountains in the north and west, the 
        Khorat Plateau in the northeast, the Chao Phraya River basin in the centre, the maritime corner of the central 
        region in the southeast, and the long, slender peninsular portion in the southwest. The northern mountains, the 
        southeastern continuation of the uplift process that formed the Himalayas, extend southward along the Thai-Myanmar 
        border and reach as far south as northern Malaysia. Long granitic ridges were formed when great masses of molten 
        rock forced their way upward through the older sedimentary strata. Peaks average about 5,200 feet (l,600 metres) 
        above sea level. Mount Inthanon, at 8,481 feet (2,585 metres) the highest in the country, is in northwestern Thailand, 
        near the historical city of Chiang Mai. The city is overshadowed by Mount Suthep, site of a famous Buddhist shrine 
        and the royal summer palace. Some of the rugged limestone hills contain caves from which remains of prehistoric humans 
        have been excavated. The northeast is coterminous with the Khorat Plateau, a vast tableland bounded by the Mekong River 
        on the north and east. It was formed by uplifting along two perpendicularly arranged crustal faults—one trending north-
        south in the west and the other east-west in the south.
