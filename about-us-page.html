        ABC is a pioneering global travel brand that’s provided trusted travel advice since 1992,
        when founder Uncle Sam established the ABC Travel Guide to several countries such as China, France,
        Spain, Japan, Thailand and Turkey. Combining a journalistic approach with an understanding of what 
        travellers really need to know, the website's instant success quickly covered half a dozen of destinations, 
        attracting a loyal readership hungry for ABC Travel Guides’ trademark “tell-it-like-it-is” ethos.

        and Berlitz Publishing, and expanding to become a full service travel platform, offering
        our ground-breaking guides.
